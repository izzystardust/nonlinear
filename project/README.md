# Project Harness

`main.go` and `util.go` are the source code to the main harness. When run, i.e. `go run main.go util.go` in this directory, they produce for each function and method a csv file of the iterates and function values at those iterates, and print the answers to the screen.

The results can be found in the `results` directory.
